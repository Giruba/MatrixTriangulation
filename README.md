# MatrixTriangulation
C# Program for the different triangulations that can be applied in a matrix

Given an any dimensional square matrix, the following triangulations can be applied.

1. Lower Triangular Matrix - All elements above the diagonal are zero. Meaning only lower traingle has elements.
2. Upper Triangular Matrix - All elements below the diagonal are zero. Matrix has elements only in the upper triangle.
3. Strictly Lower Triangular Matrix - All elements above the diagonal including the diagonal are zero.
4. Strictly Upper Triangular Matrxi - All elements below the diagonal including the diagonal are zero.

Given a matrix, all transormations can be applied on the same 


Example: 3*3 matrix 
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9


Strictly Lower Triangular of this is:
0 0 0
4 0 0
7 8 0

Choosing the Upper Triangular option will nullify the remaining elements in the matrix
